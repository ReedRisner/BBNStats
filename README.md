# BBNStats

Next.js 14 app for Kentucky men's basketball stats.

## Local run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## GitHub Pages fallback

This repository includes a Pages workflow that publishes the `site/` directory as a fallback so the apex domain does not return a GitHub 404.
The fallback instantly redirects visitors to `https://www.bbnstats.com/`.
